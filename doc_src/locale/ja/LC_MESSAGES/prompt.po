"This document uses formatting to show what a prompt would look like. If "

"Fish ships a number of prompts that you can view with the "
":doc:`fish_config <cmds/fish_config>` command, and many users have shared"
" their prompts online."

"Unlike other shells, fish's prompt is built by running a function - "

"This prints the current working directory (:envvar:`PWD`) and a ``>`` "

"The ``--`` indicates to ``string`` that no options can come after it, in "

"``set_color`` works by producing an escape sequence, which is a special "

"It's useful to display this in your prompt, but showing it when it's 0 "

"First of all, since every command (except for :doc:`set <cmds/set>`) "
