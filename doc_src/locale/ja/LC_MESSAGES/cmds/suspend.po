"``suspend`` suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a "
"SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process. It can be resumed "
"later by sending it a SIGCONT.  In order to prevent suspending a shell "
"that doesn't have a controlling process, it will not suspend the shell if"
" it is a login shell. This requirement is bypassed if the **--force** "
"option is given or the shell is not interactive."
