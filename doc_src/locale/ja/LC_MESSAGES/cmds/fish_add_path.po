":program:`fish_add_path` is a simple way to add more directories to "
"fish's :envvar:`PATH`. It does this by adding the directories either to "
":envvar:`fish_user_paths` or directly to :envvar:`PATH` (if the "
"``--path`` switch is given)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/fish_add_path.rst:18
msgid ""
"It is (by default) safe to use :program:`fish_add_path` in config.fish, "
"or it can be used once, interactively, and the paths will stay in future "
"because of :ref:`universal variables <variables-universal>`. This is a "
"\"do what I mean\" style command - it tries to do the right thing by "
"default, and follow your lead on what you have already set up (e.g. by "
"using a global :envvar:`fish_user_paths` if you have that already). If "
"you need more control, consider modifying the variable yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Directories are normalized with :doc:`realpath <realpath>`. Trailing "
"slashes are ignored and relative paths are made absolute (but symlinks "
"are not resolved). If a directory is already included, it is not added "
"again and stays in the same place unless the ``--move`` switch is given."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/fish_add_path.rst:22
msgid ""
"Directories are added in the order they are given, and they are prepended"
" to the path unless ``--append`` is given. If $fish_user_paths is used, "
"that means they are last in $fish_user_paths, which is itself prepended "
"to :envvar:`PATH`, so they still stay ahead of the system paths. If the "
"``--path`` option is used, the paths are appended/prepended to "
":envvar:`PATH` directly, so this doesn't happen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/fish_add_path.rst:24
msgid ""
"With ``--path``, because :envvar:`PATH` must be a global variable instead"
" of a universal one, the changes won't persist, so those calls need to be"
" stored in :ref:`config.fish <configuration>`. This also applies to "
":envvar:`fish_user_paths` if you make it global (for instance by passing "
"``--global``)."
