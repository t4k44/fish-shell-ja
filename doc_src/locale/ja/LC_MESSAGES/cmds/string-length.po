"With **-V** or **--visible**, it uses the visible width of the arguments."
" That means it will discount escape sequences fish knows about, account "
"for $fish_emoji_width and $fish_ambiguous_width. It will also count each "
"line (separated by ``\\n``) on its own, and with a carriage return "
"(``\\r``) count only the widest stretch on a line. The intent is to "
"measure the number of columns the *STRING* would occupy in the current "
"terminal."
