"Some shells (e.g., ksh, bash) feature a syntax that is a mix between "
"command substitution and piping, called process substitution. It is used "
"to send the output of a command into the calling command, much like "
"command substitution, but with the difference that the output is not sent"
" through commandline arguments but through a named pipe, with the "
"filename of the named pipe sent as an argument to the calling program. "
"``psub`` combined with a regular command substitution provides the same "
"functionality."

"Use a regular file instead of a named pipe to communicate with the "
"calling process. This will cause ``psub`` to be significantly slower when"
" large amounts of data are involved, but has the advantage that the "
"reading process can seek in the stream. This is the default."

"Use a named pipe rather than a file. You should only use this if the "
"command produces no more than 8 KiB of output. The limit on the amount of"
" data a FIFO can buffer varies with the OS but is typically 8 KiB, 16 KiB"
" or 64 KiB. If you use this option and the command on the left of the "
"psub pipeline produces more output a deadlock is likely to occur."
