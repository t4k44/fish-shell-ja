"``time`` causes fish to measure how long a command takes and print the "
"results afterwards. The command can be a simple fish command or a block. "
"The results can not currently be redirected."

"Your system most likely also has a ``time`` command. To use that use "
"something like ``command time``, as in ``command time sleep 10``. Because"
" it's not inside fish, it won't have access to fish functions and won't "
"be able to time blocks and such."

"The time after \"Executed in\" is what is known as the \"wall-clock "
"time\". It is simply a measure of how long it took from the start of the "
"command until it finished. Typically it is reasonably close to "
":envvar:`CMD_DURATION`, except for a slight skew because the two are "
"taken at slightly different times."

"The other times are all measures of CPU time. That means they measure how"
" long the CPU was used in this part, and they count multiple cores "
"separately. So a program with four threads using all CPU for a second "
"will have a time of 4 seconds."

"The \"usr\" time is how much CPU time was spent inside the program "
"itself, the \"sys\" time is how long was spent in the kernel on behalf of"
" that program."

"The \"fish\" time is how much CPU was spent in fish, the \"external\" "
"time how much was spent in external commands."

"So in this example, since ``string`` is a builtin, everything that "
"``string repeat`` did is accounted to fish. Any time it spends doing "
"syscalls like ``write()`` is accounted for in the fish/sys time."

"And ``grep`` here is explicitly invoked as an external command, so its "
"times will be counted in the \"external\" column."

"Note that, as in this example, the CPU times can add up to more than the "
"execution time. This is because things can be done in parallel - ``grep``"
" can match while ``string repeat`` writes."
