"**for** is a loop construct. It will perform the commands specified by "
"*COMMANDS* multiple times. On each iteration, the local variable "
"specified by *VARNAME* is assigned a new value from *VALUES*. If *VALUES*"
" is empty, *COMMANDS* will not be executed at all. The *VARNAME* is "
"visible when the loop terminates and will contain the last value assigned"
" to it. If *VARNAME* does not already exist it will be set in the local "
"scope. For our purposes if the **for** block is inside a function there "
"must be a local variable with the same name. If the **for** block is not "
"nested inside a function then global and universal variables of the same "
"name will be used if they exist."

"The last value assigned to ``var`` when the loop terminated would not be "
