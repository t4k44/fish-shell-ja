"``string sub`` prints a substring of each string argument. The start/end "
"of the substring can be specified with **-s**/**-e** or "
"**--start**/**--end** followed by a 1-based index value. Positive index "
"values are relative to the start of the string and negative index values "
"are relative to the end of the string. The default start value is 1. The "
"length of the substring can be specified with **-l** or **--length**. If "
"the length or end is not specified, the substring continues to the end of"
" each STRING. Exit status: 0 if at least one substring operation was "
"performed, 1 otherwise. **--length** is mutually exclusive with "
"**--end**."
