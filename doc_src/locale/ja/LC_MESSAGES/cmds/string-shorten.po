"``string shorten`` truncates each *STRING* to the given visible width and"
" adds an ellipsis to indicate it. \"Visible width\" means the width of "
"all visible characters added together, excluding escape sequences and "
"accounting for :envvar:`fish_emoji_width` and "
":envvar:`fish_ambiguous_width`. It is the amount of columns in a terminal"
" the *STRING* occupies."

"The escape sequences reflect what fish knows about, and how it computes "
"its output. Your terminal might support more escapes, or not support "
"escape sequences that fish knows about."

"If **-m** or **--max** is given, truncate at the given width. Otherwise, "
"the lowest non-zero width of all input strings is used. A max of 0 means "
"no shortening takes place, all STRINGs are printed as-is."

msgid ""
"If **-N** or **--no-newline** is given, only the first line (or last line"
" with **--left**) of each STRING is used, and an ellipsis is added if it "
"was multiline. This only works for STRINGs being given as arguments, "
"multiple lines given on stdin will be interpreted as separate STRINGs "
"instead."

"If **-c** or **--char** is given, add *CHAR* instead of an ellipsis. This"
" can also be empty or more than one character."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/string-shorten.rst:31
msgid ""
"If **-l** or **--left** is given, remove text from the left on instead, "
"so this prints the longest *suffix* of the string that fits. With **--no-"
"newline**, this will take from the last line instead of the first."

"If **-q** or **--quiet** is given, ``string shorten`` only runs for the "

"The default ellipsis is ``…``. If fish thinks your system is incapable "
