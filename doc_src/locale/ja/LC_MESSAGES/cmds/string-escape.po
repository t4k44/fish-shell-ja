"**--style=script** (default) alters the string such that it can be passed"
" back to ``eval`` to produce the original argument again. By default, all"
" special characters are escaped, and quotes are used to simplify the "
"output when possible. If **-n** or **--no-quoted** is given, the "
"simplifying quoted format is not used. Exit status: 0 if at least one "
"string was escaped, or 1 otherwise."

"``string unescape`` performs the inverse of the ``string escape`` "
"command. If the string to be unescaped is not properly formatted it is "
"ignored. For example, doing ``string unescape --style=var (string escape "
"--style=var $str)`` will return the original string. There is no support "
"for unescaping **--style=regex**."
