"The language depends on the current locale, set with :envvar:`LANG`, "
":envvar:`LC_MESSAGES`, :envvar:`LC_ALL`, and :envvar:`LANGUAGE`. These "
"variables do not have to be exported for fish to use them, and fish's "

" respect these locale variables they have to be exported to make them "
"available outside of fish."
