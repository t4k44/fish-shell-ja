"``switch`` performs one of several blocks of commands, depending on "
"whether a specified value equals one of several globbed values. ``case`` "
"is used together with the ``switch`` statement in order to determine "
"which block should be executed."

msgid ""
"Each ``case`` command is given one or more parameters. The first ``case``"
" command with a parameter that matches the string specified in the switch"
" command will be evaluated. ``case`` parameters may contain globs. These "
"need to be escaped or quoted in order to avoid regular glob expansion "
"using filenames."

"Note that fish does not fall through on case statements. Only the first "
"matching case is executed."

"Note that :doc:`break <break>` cannot be used to exit a case/switch block"

"Note that command substitutions in a case statement will be evaluated "
"even if its body is not taken. All substitutions, including command "
"substitutions, must be performed before the value can be compared against"
" the parameter."
