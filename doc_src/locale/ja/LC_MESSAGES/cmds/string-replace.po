"``string replace`` is similar to ``string match`` but replaces non-"
"overlapping matching substrings with a replacement string and prints the "
"result. By default, *PATTERN* is treated as a literal substring to be "
"matched."

"If **-r** or **--regex** is given, *PATTERN* is interpreted as a Perl-"
"compatible regular expression, and *REPLACEMENT* can contain C-style "
"escape sequences like **\\t** as well as references to capturing groups "
"by number or name as *$n* or *${n}*."

"If you specify the **-f** or **--filter** flag then each input string is "
"printed only if a replacement was done. This is useful where you would "
"otherwise use this idiom: ``a_cmd | string match pattern | string replace"
" pattern new_pattern``. You can instead just write ``a_cmd | string "
"replace --filter pattern new_pattern``."

"If **--max-matches MAX** or **-m MAX** is used, ``string replace`` will "
"stop all processing after MAX lines of input have matched the specified "
"pattern. In the event of ``--filter`` or ``-f``, this means the output "
"will be MAX lines in length. This can be used as an \"early exit\" "
"optimization when processing long inputs but expecting a limited and "
"fixed number of outputs that might be found considerably before the input"
" stream has been exhausted."
