"**WARNING**: Insert a  ``--`` before positional arguments to prevent them"
" from being interpreted as flags. Otherwise, any strings starting with "
"``-`` will be treated as flag arguments, meaning they will most likely "
"result in the command failing. This is also true if you specify a "
"variable which expands to such a string instead of a literal string. If "
"you don't need to append flag arguments at the end of the command, just "
"always use ``--`` to avoid unwelcome surprises."

"``string join0`` adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction "
"with tools that accept NUL-delimited input, such as ``sort -z``."

"Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of "
"``string join0`` as an *argument* to a command (via a :ref:`command "
"substitution <expand-command-substitution>`) won't actually work. Fish "
"will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won't be able to tell "
"where the argument ends. This is a limitation of Unix' argument passing."
