"``cdh`` with no arguments presents a list of :ref:`recently visited "
"directories <directory-history>`. You can then select one of the entries "
"by letter or number. You can also press :kbd:`tab` to use the completion "
"pager to select an item from the list. If you give it a single argument "
"it is equivalent to ``cd DIRECTORY``."

"Note that the ``cd`` command limits directory history to the 25 most "
"recently visited directories. The history is stored in the "
":envvar:`dirprev` and :envvar:`dirnext` variables, which this command "
"manipulates. If you make those universal variables, your ``cd`` history "
"is shared among all fish instances."
