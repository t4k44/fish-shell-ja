"``string split`` splits each *STRING* on the separator *SEP*, which can "
"be an empty string. If **-m** or **--max** is specified, at most MAX "
"splits are done on each *STRING*. If **-r** or **--right** is given, "
"splitting is performed right-to-left. This is only useful in combination "
"with **-m** or **--max**. With **-n** or **--no-empty**, empty results "
"are excluded from consideration (e.g. ``hello\\n\\nworld`` would expand "
"to two strings and not three). Exit status: 0 if at least one split was "
"performed, or 1 otherwise."

"Use **-f** or **--fields** to print out specific fields. FIELDS is a "
"comma-separated string of field numbers and/or spans. Each field is one-"
"indexed, and will be printed on separate lines. If a given field does not"
" exist, then the command exits with status 1 and does not print anything,"
" unless **--allow-empty** is used."

"``string split0`` splits each *STRING* on the zero byte (NUL). Options "
"are the same as ``string split`` except that no separator is given."

"``split0`` has the important property that its output is not further "
"split when used in a command substitution, allowing for the command "
"substitution to produce elements containing newlines. This is most useful"
" when used with Unix tools that produce zero bytes, such as ``find "
"-print0`` or ``sort -z``. See split0 examples below."

"Be aware that commandline arguments cannot include NULs, so you likely "
