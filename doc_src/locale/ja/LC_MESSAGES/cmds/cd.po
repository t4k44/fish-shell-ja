"Fish also ships a wrapper function around the builtin **cd** that "
"understands ``cd -`` as changing to the previous directory. See also "
":doc:`prevd <prevd>`. This wrapper function maintains a history of the 25"
" most recently visited directories in the ``$dirprev`` and ``$dirnext`` "
"global variables. If you make those universal variables your **cd** "
"history is shared among all fish instances."
