"Returns history items matching the search string. If no search string is "
"provided it returns all history items. This is the default operation if "
"no other operation is specified. You only have to explicitly say "
"``history search`` if you wish to search for one of the subcommands. The "
"``--contains`` search option will be used if you don't specify a "
"different search option. Entries are ordered newest to oldest unless you "
"use the ``--reverse`` flag. If stdout is attached to a tty the output "
"will be piped through your pager by the history function. The history "
"builtin writes the results to stdout."

"Deletes history items. The ``--contains`` search option will be used if "
"you don't specify a different search option. If you don't specify "
"``--exact`` a prompt will be displayed before any items are deleted "
"asking you which entries are to be deleted. You can enter the word "
"\"all\" to delete all matching entries. You can enter a single ID (the "
"number in square brackets) to delete just that single entry. You can "
"enter more than one ID, or an ID range separated by a space to delete "
"multiple entries. Press [enter] to not delete anything. Note that the "
"interactive delete behavior is a feature of the history function. The "
"history builtin only supports ``--exact --case-sensitive`` deletion."

"Other shells such as bash and zsh use a variable named ``HISTFILE`` for a"
