"``funcsave`` saves a function to a file in the fish configuration "
"directory. This function will be :ref:`automatically loaded <syntax-"
"function-autoloading>` by current and future fish sessions. This can be "
"useful to commit functions created interactively for permanent use."

"If you have erased a function using :doc:`functions <functions>`'s "
"``--erase`` option, ``funcsave`` will remove the saved function "
"definition."

"Because fish loads functions on-demand, saved functions cannot serve as "
":ref:`event handlers <event>` until they are run or otherwise sourced. To"
" activate an event handler for every new shell, add the function to the "
":ref:`configuration file <configuration>` instead of using ``funcsave``."

"This is often used after :doc:`funced <funced>`, which opens the function"
