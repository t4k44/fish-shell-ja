"``switch`` executes one of several blocks of commands, depending on "
"whether a specified value matches one of several values. ``case`` is used"
" together with the ``switch`` statement in order to determine which block"
" should be executed."

"Each ``case`` command is given one or more parameters. The first ``case``"
" command with a parameter that matches the string specified in the switch"
" command will be evaluated. ``case`` parameters may contain wildcards. "
"These need to be escaped or quoted in order to avoid regular wildcard "
"expansion using filenames."
