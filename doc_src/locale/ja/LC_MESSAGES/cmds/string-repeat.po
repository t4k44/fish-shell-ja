"``string repeat`` repeats the *STRING* **-n** or **--count** times. The "
"**-m** or **--max** option will limit the number of outputted characters "
"(excluding the newline). This option can be used by itself or in "
"conjunction with **--count**. If both **--count** and **--max** are "
"present, max char will be outputted unless the final repeated string size"
" is less than max, in that case, the string will repeat until count has "
"been reached. Both **--count** and **--max** will accept a number greater"
" than or equal to zero, in the case of zero, nothing will be outputted. "
"The first argument is interpreted as *COUNT* if **--count** or **--max** "
"are not explicitly specified. If **-N** or **--no-newline** is given, the"
" output won't contain a newline character at the end. Exit status: 0 if "
"yielded string is not empty, 1 otherwise."
