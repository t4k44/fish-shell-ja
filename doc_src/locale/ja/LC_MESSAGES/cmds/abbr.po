"``abbr`` manages abbreviations - user-defined words that are replaced "
"with longer phrases when entered."

"For example, a frequently-run command like ``git checkout`` can be "
"abbreviated to ``gco``. After entering ``gco`` and pressing :kbd:`space` "
"or :kbd:`enter`, the full text ``git checkout`` will appear in the "
"command line. To avoid expanding something that looks like an "
"abbreviation, the default :kbd:`ctrl-space` binding inserts a space "
"without expanding."

msgid ""
"An abbreviation may match a literal word, or it may match a pattern given"
" by a regular expression. When an abbreviation matches a word, that word "
"is replaced by new text, called its *expansion*. This expansion may be a "
"fixed new phrase, or it can be dynamically created via a fish function. "
"This expansion occurs after pressing space or enter."

"Combining these features, it is possible to create custom syntaxes, where"
" a regular expression recognizes matching tokens, and the expansion "
"function interprets them. See the `Examples`_ section."

"Previous versions of this allowed saving abbreviations in universal "
"variables. That's no longer possible. Existing variables will still be "
"imported and ``abbr --erase`` will also erase the variables. We recommend"
" adding abbreviations to :ref:`config.fish <configuration>` by just "
"adding the ``abbr --add`` command. When you run ``abbr``, you will see "
"output like this"

"In that case you should take the part before the ``#`` comment and save "
"it in :ref:`config.fish <configuration>`, then you can run ``abbr "
"--erase`` to remove the universal variable::"

"Alternatively you can keep them in a separate :ref:`configuration file "
"<configuration>` by doing something like the following::"

"This will save all your abbreviations in \"myabbrs.fish\", overwriting "

"With **--position command**, the abbreviation will only expand when it is"

"With **--command COMMAND**, the abbreviation will only expand when it is "
"used as an argument to the given COMMAND. Multiple **--command** can be "
"used together, and the abbreviation will expand for each. An empty "
"**COMMAND** means it will expand only when there is no command. "
"**--command** implies **--position anywhere** and disallows **--position "
"command**. Even with different **COMMANDS**, the **NAME** of the "
"abbreviation needs to be unique. Consider using **--regex** if you want "
"to expand the same word differently for multiple commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/abbr.rst:72
msgid ""
"With **--regex**, the abbreviation matches using the regular expression "
"given by **PATTERN**, instead of the literal **NAME**. The pattern is "
"interpreted using PCRE2 syntax and must match the entire token. If "
"multiple abbreviations match the same token, the last abbreviation added "
"is used."

"**MARKER** may be omitted (i.e. simply ``--set-cursor``), in which case "
"it defaults to ``%``."

"With **-f FUNCTION** or **--function FUNCTION**, **FUNCTION** is treated "
"as the name of a fish function instead of a literal replacement. When the"
" abbreviation matches, the function will be called with the matching "
"token as an argument. If the function's exit status is 0 (success), the "
"token will be replaced by the function's output; otherwise the token will"
" be left unchanged. No **EXPANSION** may be given separately."
