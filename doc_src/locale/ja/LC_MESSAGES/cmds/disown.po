msgid ""
"``disown`` removes the specified :ref:`job <syntax-job-control>` from the"
" list of jobs. The job itself continues to exist, but fish does not keep "
"track of it any longer. This will make fish lose all knowledge of the "
"job, so functions defined with ``--on-process-exit`` or ``--on-job-exit``"
" will no longer fire."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/disown.rst:17
msgid ""
"Jobs in the list of jobs are sent a hang-up signal when fish terminates, "
"which usually causes the job to terminate; ``disown`` allows these "
"processes to continue regardless."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/cmds/disown.rst:19
msgid ""
"If no process is specified, the most recently-used job is removed (like "
":doc:`bg <bg>` and :doc:`fg <fg>`).  If one or more PIDs are specified, "
"jobs with the specified process IDs are removed from the job list. "
"Invalid jobs are ignored and a warning is printed."

msgid ""
"If a job is stopped, it is sent a signal to continue running, and a "
"warning is printed. It is not possible to use the :doc:`bg <bg>` builtin "
"to continue a job once it has been disowned."

"``disown`` returns 0 if all specified jobs were disowned successfully, "
"and 1 if any problems were encountered."

"``firefox &; disown`` will start the Firefox web browser in the "
"background and remove it from the job list, meaning it will not be closed"
" when the fish process is closed."
