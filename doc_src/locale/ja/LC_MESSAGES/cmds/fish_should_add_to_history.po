"The ``fish_should_add_to_history`` function is executed before fish adds "
"a command to history, and its return status decides whether that is done."

"If it returns 0, the command is stored in history, when it returns "
"anything else, it is not. In the latter case the command can still be "
"recalled for one command."

"The first argument to ``fish_should_add_to_history`` is the commandline. "
"History is added *before* a command is run, so e.g. :envvar:`status` "
"can't be checked. This is so commands that don't finish like :doc:`exec` "
"and long-running commands are available in new sessions immediately."

"If ``fish_should_add_to_history`` doesn't exist, fish will save a command"
" to history unless it starts with a space. If it does exist, this "
"function takes over all of the duties, so commands starting with space "
"are saved unless ``fish_should_add_to_history`` says otherwise."
