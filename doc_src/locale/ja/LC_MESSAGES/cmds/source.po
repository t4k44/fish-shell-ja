"``source`` evaluates the commands of the specified *FILE* in the current "
"shell as a new block of code. This is different from starting a new "
"process to perform the commands (i.e. ``fish < FILE``) since the commands"
" will be evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in "
"shell variables will affect the current shell. If additional arguments "
"are specified after the file name, they will be inserted into the "
":envvar:`argv` variable. The :envvar:`argv` variable will not include the"
" name of the sourced file."

"If no file is specified and a file or pipeline is connected to standard "
