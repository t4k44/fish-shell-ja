"to the foreground, resuming it if it is stopped. While a foreground job "
"is executed, fish is suspended. If no job is specified, the last job to "
"be used is put in the foreground. If ``PID`` is specified, the job "
"containing a process with the specified process ID is put in the "
"foreground."
