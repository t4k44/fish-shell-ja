"The simplest method is to set your terminal emulator (e.g. GNOME "

" (the exact path depends on how you installed fish)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:70
msgid ""
"Setting fish as your login shell may cause issues, such as an incorrect "
":envvar:`PATH`. Some operating systems, including a number of Linux "

msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:92
msgid ""
"Because shell scripts are written in many different languages, they need "
"to carry information about which interpreter should be used to execute "
"them. For this, they are expected to have a first line, the shebang line,"
" which names the interpreter executable."

"When the shell tells the kernel to execute the file, it will use the "
"interpreter ``/bin/bash``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:101
msgid ""
"For a script written in another language, just replace ``/bin/bash`` with"
" the interpreter for that language. For example: ``/usr/bin/python`` for "
"a python script, or ``/usr/local/bin/fish`` for a fish script, if that is"
" where you have them installed."

"If you want to share your script with others, you might want to use "
":command:`env` to allow for the interpreter to be installed in other "
"locations. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:108
msgid ""
"This will call ``env``, which then goes through :envvar:`PATH` to find a "
"program called \"fish\". This makes it work, whether fish is installed in"
" (for example) ``/usr/local/bin/fish``, ``/usr/bin/fish``, or "
"``~/.local/bin/fish``, as long as that directory is in :envvar:`PATH`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:110
msgid ""
"The shebang line is only used when scripts are executed without "
"specifying the interpreter. For functions inside fish or when executing a"
" script with ``fish /path/to/script``, a shebang is not required (but it "
"doesn't hurt!)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/index.rst:112
msgid ""
"When executing files without an interpreter, fish, like other shells, "
"tries your system shell, typically ``/bin/sh``. This is needed because "

"These files are read on the startup of every shell, whether interactive "
