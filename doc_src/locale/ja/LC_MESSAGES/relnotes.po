" should now work reliably, and the runtime implementation, where we no "
"longer dynamically link to gettext, but instead use our own "
"implementation, whose behavior is similar to GNU gettext, with some "
":doc:`minor deviations <cmds/_>`. Our implementation now fully respects "
"fish variables, so locale variables do not have to be exported for fish "
"localizations to work. They still have to be exported to inform other "
"programs about language preferences. The :envvar:`LANGUAGE` environment "
"variable is now treated as a path variable, meaning it is an implicitly "
"colon-separated list. While we no longer have any runtime dependency on "
"gettext, we still need gettext tools for building, most notably "
"``msgfmt``. When building without ``msgfmt`` available, localization will"
" not work with the resulting executable. Localization data is no longer "
"sourced at runtime from MO files on the file system, but instead built "
"into the executable. This is always done, independently of the other data"
" embedding, so all fish executables will have access to all message "
"catalogs, regardless of the state of the file system. Disabling our new "
"``localize-messages`` cargo feature will cause fish to be built without "
"localization support. CMake builds can continue to use the "
"``WITH_GETTEXT`` option, with the same semantics as the ``localize-"
"messages`` feature. The current implementation does not provide any "
"configuration options for controlling which language catalogs are built "

"**Web-based configuration** page. There is a new function ‘fish_config’. "
"This spins up a simple Python web server and opens a browser window to "
"it. From this web page, you can set your shell colors and view your "
"functions, variables, and history; all changes apply immediately to all "
"running shells. Eventually all configuration ought to be supported via "
"this mechanism (but in addition to, not instead of, command line "
"mechanisms)."

"your manpath, removes the roff formatting, parses them to find the "
"commands and options, and outputs fish completions into "
"~/.config/fish/completions. It won’t overwrite existing completion files "
