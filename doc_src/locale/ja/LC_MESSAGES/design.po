"This is a description of the design principles that have been used to "
"design fish. The fish design has three high level goals. These are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:6
msgid ""
"Everything that can be done in other shell languages should be possible "
"to do in fish, though fish may rely on external commands in doing so."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:8
msgid ""
"Fish should be user-friendly, but not at the expense of expressiveness. "
"Most tradeoffs between power and ease of use can be avoided with careful "
"design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:10
msgid ""
"Whenever possible without breaking the above goals, fish should follow "
"POSIX."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:12
msgid ""
"To achieve these high-level goals, the fish design relies on a number of "
"more specific design principles. These are presented below, together with"
" a rationale and a few examples for each."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:16
msgid "The law of orthogonality"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:18
msgid ""
"The shell language should have a small set of orthogonal features. Any "
"situation where two features are related but not identical, one of them "
"should be removed, and the other should be made powerful and general "
"enough to handle all common use cases of either feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:20
msgid ""
"Rationale: Related features make the language larger, which makes it "
"harder to learn. It also increases the size of the source code, making "
"the program harder to maintain and update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:25
msgid "Here documents are too similar to using echo inside of a pipeline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:27
msgid ""
"Subshells, command substitution and process substitution are strongly "
"related. ``fish`` only supports command substitution, the others can be "
"achieved either using a block or the psub shellscript function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:29
msgid ""
"Having both aliases and functions is confusing, especially since both of "
"them have limitations and problems. ``fish`` functions have none of the "
"drawbacks of either syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:31
msgid "The many Posix quoting styles are silly, especially ``$``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:35
msgid "The law of responsiveness"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:37
msgid ""
"The shell should attempt to remain responsive to the user at all times, "
"even in the face of contended or unresponsive filesystems. It is only "
"acceptable to block in response to a user initiated action, such as "
"running a command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:39
msgid ""
"Rationale: Bad performance increases user-facing complexity, because it "
"trains users to recognize and route around slow use cases. It is also "
"incredibly frustrating."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:44
msgid ""
"Features like syntax highlighting and autosuggestions must perform all of"
" their disk I/O asynchronously."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:46
msgid ""
"Startup should minimize forks and disk I/O, so that fish can be started "
"even if the system is under load."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:49
msgid "Configurability is the root of all evil"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:51
msgid ""
"Every configuration option in a program is a place where the program is "
"too stupid to figure out for itself what the user really wants, and "
"should be considered a failure of both the program and the programmer who"
" implemented it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:53
msgid ""
"Rationale: Different configuration options are a nightmare to maintain, "
"since the number of potential bugs caused by specific configuration "
"combinations quickly becomes an issue. Configuration options often imply "
"assumptions about the code which change when reimplementing the code, "
"causing issues with backwards compatibility. But mostly, configuration "
"options should be avoided since they simply should not exist, as the "
"program should be smart enough to do what is best, or at least a good "
"enough approximation of it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:58
msgid ""
"Fish allows the user to set various syntax highlighting colors. This is "
"needed because fish does not know what colors the terminal uses by "
"default, which might make some things unreadable. The proper solution "
"would be for text color preferences to be defined centrally by the user "
"for all programs, and for the terminal emulator to send these color "
"properties to fish."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:60
msgid ""
"Fish does not allow you to set the number of history entries, different "
"language substyles or any number of other common shell configuration "
"options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:62
msgid ""
"A special note on the evils of configurability is the long list of very "
"useful features found in some shells, that are not turned on by default. "
"Both zsh and bash support command-specific completions, but no such "
"completions are shipped with bash by default, and they are turned off by "
"default in zsh. Other features that zsh supports that are disabled by "
"default include tab-completion of strings containing wildcards, a sane "
"completion pager and a history file."

msgid "The law of user focus"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:67
msgid ""
"When designing a program, one should first think about how to make an "
"intuitive and powerful program. Implementation issues should only be "
"considered once a user interface has been designed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:69
msgid ""
"Rationale: This design rule is different than the others, since it "
"describes how one should go about designing new features, not what the "
"features should be. The problem with focusing on what can be done, and "
"what is easy to do, is that too much of the implementation is exposed. "
"This means that the user must know a great deal about the underlying "
"system to be able to guess how the shell works, it also means that the "
"language will often be rather low-level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:74
msgid ""
"There should only be one type of input to the shell, lists of commands. "
"Loops, conditionals and variable assignments are all performed through "
"regular commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:76
msgid ""
"The differences between built-in commands and shellscript functions "
"should be made as small as possible. Built-ins and shellscript functions "
"should have exactly the same types of argument expansion as other "
"commands, should be possible to use in any position in a pipeline, and "
"should support any I/O redirection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:78
msgid ""
"Instead of forking when performing command substitution to provide a fake"
" variable scope, all fish commands are performed from the same process, "
"and fish instead supports true scoping."

msgid "The law of discoverability"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:85
msgid ""
"A program should be designed to make its features as easy as possible to "
"discover for the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:87
msgid ""
"Rationale: A program whose features are discoverable turns a new user "
"into an expert in a shorter span of time, since the user will become an "
"expert on the program simply by using it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:90
msgid ""
"The main benefit of a graphical program over a command-line-based program"
" is discoverability. In a graphical program, one can discover all the "
"common features by simply looking at the user interface and guessing what"
" the different buttons, menus and other widgets do. The traditional way "
"to discover features in command-line programs is through manual pages. "
"This requires both that the user starts to use a different program, and "
"then they remember the new information until the next time they use the "
"same program."

"Everything should be tab-completable, and every tab completion should "
"have a description."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:96
msgid ""
"Every syntax error and error in a built-in command should contain an "
"error message describing what went wrong and a relevant help page. "
"Whenever possible, errors should be flagged red by the syntax "
"highlighter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:98
msgid ""
"The help manual should be easy to read, easily available from the shell, "
"complete and contain many examples"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc_src/design.rst:100
msgid ""
"The language should be uniform, so that once the user understands the "
"command/argument syntax, they will know the whole language, and be able "
"to use tab-completion to discover new features."
