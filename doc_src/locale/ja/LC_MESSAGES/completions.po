"To specify a completion, use the ``complete`` command. ``complete`` takes"
" as a parameter the name of the command to specify a completion for. For "
"example, to add a completion for the program ``myprog`` (or "

"completion command with ``complete -c myprog ...``"

"``fish`` ships with several functions that may be useful when writing "

"Functions beginning with the string ``__fish_print_`` print a newline "
